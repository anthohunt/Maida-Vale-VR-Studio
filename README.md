Introduction
The Maida-Vale VR Studio project is a comprehensive VR application, featuring a range of functionalities to enhance virtual reality experiences. Below is an overview of the key script components and their roles within the project.

Script Summaries
AvatarManager.cs: Manages avatar representations in the VR environment. This script could be responsible for handling avatar creation, customization, or control within the virtual space.

CustomTwoGrabFreeTransformer.cs: Implements a custom transformation mechanic, possibly for objects or entities within the VR space. This script likely allows for advanced interaction techniques such as scaling, rotating, or moving objects with two-hand controls.

FPSLatencyMeasurement.cs: Monitors and records the frames per second (FPS) and latency in the VR environment. This is crucial for ensuring a smooth and responsive VR experience.

FaceAnalyser.cs: Analyzes facial expressions or features. This script might be used for avatar facial expression synchronization or for emotion detection within VR.

InstrumentManager.cs: Manages musical instruments or similar interactive objects in the VR setting. It could handle the logic for playing, controlling, and interacting with virtual instruments.

LocalDataBuffer.cs: Handles data buffering, potentially for network operations or data streaming in VR. This script ensures efficient data handling and transfer within the application.

MasterControl.cs: Acts as the central control script for the VR application, likely coordinating various aspects of the VR experience, such as scene management, user interactions, and system settings.

MenuManager.cs: Manages in-app menus and user interfaces. This script is key for navigation, settings adjustments, and user interaction within the VR environment.

NetworkManager.cs: Handles network connectivity and communication. It's vital for multiplayer or online aspects of the VR experience, ensuring smooth data exchange and interaction between different users.

PassthroughManager.cs: Likely manages the integration of real-world visuals into the VR space, a feature known as 'passthrough' in VR systems. This can enhance user orientation and safety.

ResearchConditionsManager.cs: Manages experimental or research conditions within the VR application. This script could be used for studies, user testing, or controlled environment settings.

TestDummyData.cs: Provides dummy data for testing purposes. It's essential for the development phase, allowing developers to test functionalities without the need for live data.

TimeStamp.cs: Handles time-stamping functionalities, which could be used for event logging, performance measurement, or time-based actions within the VR application.
