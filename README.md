# Introduction
The Maida-Vale VR Studio project is a comprehensive VR application, featuring a range of functionalities to enhance music band virtual reality experiences. Below is an overview of the key script components and their roles within the project.

# Script Summaries

## AvatarManager.cs
**Manages avatar representations in the VR environment.** This script handles avatar creation, customization, and control within the virtual space.

## CustomTwoGrabFreeTransformer.cs
**Implements a custom transformation mechanic,** for objects or entities within the VR space. This script allows for advanced interaction techniques such as scaling, rotating, or moving objects with two-hand controls.

## FPSLatencyMeasurement.cs
**Monitors and records the frames per second (FPS) and latency** in the VR environment.

## FaceAnalyser.cs
**Analyzes facial expressions and features.** This script is used for avatar facial expression synchronization and emotion detection within VR.

## InstrumentManager.cs
**Manages musical instruments objects** in the VR setting. It handles the logic for playing, controlling, and interacting with virtual instruments.

## LocalDataBuffer.cs
**Handles data buffering,** for network operations or data streaming in VR. This script ensures efficient data handling and transfer within the application.

## MasterControl.cs
**Acts as the central control script for the VR application,** coordinating various aspects of the VR experience, such as scene management, user interactions, and system settings.

## MenuManager.cs
**Manages in-app menus and user interfaces.** This script is key for navigation, settings adjustments, and user interaction within the VR environment.

## NetworkManager.cs
**Handles network connectivity and communication.** It is vital for multiplayer or online aspects of the VR experience, ensuring smooth data exchange and interaction between different users.

## PassthroughManager.cs
**Manages the integration of real-world visuals into the VR space,** a feature known as 'passthrough' in VR systems. This enhances user orientation and safety.

## ResearchConditionsManager.cs
**Manages experimental and research conditions** within the VR application. This script is used for studies, user testing, and controlled environment settings.

## TestDummyData.cs
**Provides dummy data for testing purposes.** It is essential for the development phase, allowing developers to test functionalities without the need for live data.

## TimeStamp.cs
**Handles time-stamping functionalities,** which are used for event logging, performance measurement, or time-based actions within the VR application.
